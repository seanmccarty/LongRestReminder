# LongRestReminders
Create a Story entry named LRR. This Story entry will be displayed to the GM when a Long Rest is taken.

Use /LRRshortrest and /LRRlongrest commands to pin the Rest functions to the hotkey bar. Type the commands into the  chat, and then drag it to the hotkey bar for the quick access.
